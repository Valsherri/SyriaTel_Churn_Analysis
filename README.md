# SyriaTel_Churn_Analysis
Machine Learning Project
## Overview
SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications provider in Syria, is experiencing an increase in customer churn. Understanding the factors leading to service discontinuation is crucial for enhancing customer retention strategies. This analysis focuses on identifying predictive features that might indicate potential churn.
## Objectives
1. Identify key indicators of customer churn: Determine which customer characteristics, behaviors, or interactions are most strongly associated with discontinuing service.

2. Develop a predictive model for customer churn: Create a model that can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn in the future.

3. Formulate proactive customer retention strategies: Use the insights gained from the analysis to design and implement strategies to reduce customer churn, such as targeted promotions, improved customer service, or personalized communication.

## Recommendation
### 1. Proactive Customer Service:
 - Focus on customers with a high number of customer service calls.
- Implement a system to identify customers exceeding a threshold (e.g., 4 calls) and offer proactive support. This could involve personalized outreach, special offers, or early problem resolution.

### 2. International Plan Review:
 - Analyze customer behavior with international plans.
 - Identify pain points or dissatisfaction related to international plans. Improve plan offerings or address customer concerns promptly.


### 3. Optimize Pricing for Daytime Usage:
- Examine total day charges and their relationship to churn.
 - Investigate potential adjustments to pricing plans for daytime usage, potentially offering tiered plans or more competitive rates for high-usage customers.

### 4. Targeted Customer Retention Programs:
- Segment customers based on churn risk factors (customer service calls, international plans, daytime usage).
- Develop tailored retention programs for each segment.  Offer discounts, loyalty rewards, or upgrades to retain high-risk customers.


### 5. Continuous Monitoring and Model Refinement:
 - Periodically re-evaluate the churn prediction model using updated data.
 - Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to track the effectiveness of implemented strategies and adjust accordingly.
 - Continuously collect feedback from customers to identify and address emerging issues promptly.
